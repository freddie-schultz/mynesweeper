During Dev Academy, we were given a task to create a version of Minesweeper, but with a lot of the app pre-written for us. I love Minesweeper and I was looking for a challenge, so I decided to have a go at writing Minesweeper from scratch first before looking at the pre-written version. This is what I made!
